## Intro

I recently wondered what would happen if my laptop to fail. 

I have the important things backed up to Dropbox and Github. But, I also have a bunch of custom things I'd regret loosing, but arn't really worth the trouble of backing up. In addition, I'm not really sure what I'd do in between fixing/getting an new mac. 

I need a plan. 

## A Plan

So, my goals are two fold. 

* (1) Back up all the things. 
* (2) Have an easy way to access those things. 


For (1) I want a to use Time Machine on AWS somehow. 

For (2) I want a Virtualied MacOS on AWS.

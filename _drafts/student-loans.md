# Student Loans 

## Intro 

I went to college and came out with a degree in mathematics and only four thousand in loans. This amount is *low*, but six months have passed and the Grace Period is finished. Now I need to choose a plan. 

## Choice Among Options

I can (1) use traditional fixed payment option, or (2) repay based on income. 

Since I have no income at the moment, I'll be going with option (2).

Now there are a few different *plans* I can pick from: 

Note each of (A-B-C-D) takes $\ge 20$ years. 

* (A) Income-Based Repayment Plan (IBR)
    - "Generally 10 percent of your discretionary income if you're a new borrower on or after July 1, 2014*, but never more than the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan amount"
* (B) Pay As You Earn Repayment Plan (PAYE)
    - "Generally 10 percent of your discretionary income, but never more than the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan amount"
* (C) Revised Pay As You Earn Repayment Plan (REPAYE)
    - "Generally 10 percent of your discretionary income."
* (D) Income-Contingent Repayment Plan (ICR Plan)
    - Min of: 
        + "20 percent of your discretionary income or"
        + "what you would pay on a repayment plan with a fixed payment over the course of 12 years, adjusted according to your income"

So, (B) is just the lower-payment-version of (A), and (C) is just (B) but with less restrictions. Now, (D) is (A) but for people who borrowed via their parents. 

Thus, ***I chose you*** REPAYE.

## Faith/Works

So, I'm in James right now, and I'm on the portion of Faith/Works. 

What are simple interpretations of this passage? 
    Faith implies Works, James 2:14
        “What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith  o but does not have works? Can that faith save him?” “If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, 16 q and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? 17So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.”
        Caveat. Works do not imply Faith
    Faith without works is useless, James 2:20
        Caveat. Salvation stands: based on grance not works, Rom. 11:6

What do I need to define? 
    Grace
        Unmerited favor (a gift)
    Salvation
        Def. Believe Jesus dies for you 
    Faith
        Def. God exists **and** Confident assurance in God's promises, Heb. 11:1
        Non Example. *only* beliving God exists, James 2:19 
    Works
        Def. Acting according to Faith

What are some simple analogies? 
    Implication: 
        School $\thn$ Homework
        Driving $\thn$ Traveling
    Faith/Works:
        Faith in the chair $\thn$ Sit in the chair

Does my life always reflect my faith? 
    No. Sometimes I choose to forget, choose to focus on what's before me. 

What does this mean personnally? 
    This is a test. I can look at the my actions, my habits, my schedule and see if it lines up with the Gospel I *claim* to adhere to. 
    I've failed the test. I don't always have works, I fail each day by choosing to forget his promises, instead, doing what *feels* okay. 
    I know I can do better.

What can I do better?
    Strengthen Faith: 
        e.g. Hear the Word (his promises), know them, choose to believe they are true. 
        Promises: 
            (1) He keeps them, Hebrews 10:23 
                Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful.
            (2) Eternal life, John 3:16
                For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life
            (3) He's with us, Matt. 28:20
            (4) If we confess then he forgives, 1 John 1:9
            (5) If we ask wisdom he gives it, James 1:5
    Act out Faith: 
        being convinced of God *will* change your actions

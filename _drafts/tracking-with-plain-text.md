So, it has come to my attention that adults keep track of their (1) time and (2) expenses. I wish to join in. Fortunately, I haven't really diving into this before. So I have no bad habits. 

What initially attracted me to this was [this manifesto](http://plaintextaccounting.org) endorsing plan text logging. 

Now, the trap I usually fall into is choosing the most complicated tool for the job, because, you know, *features*. Lets try to avoid that this time. There is a tool called [Ledger](https://www.ledger-cli.org) that fulfills both time and expense tracking. I can use a script called [t](https://github.com/nuex/t) to easily make time transactions. 

See, Ledger is *old*, like, really old. It's *so* old, that several new forks of it have matured into fully realized tools. Now, since none of these forks have replaced it, I'm guessing it's exactly what the common man needs.

Now, how do we go about using it? 

First, I need to choose a start date. To keep things simple, I'm picking today. Thus, a certain amount of money is just going to *show up* from the void in my initial account. 

Next, installation with syntax highlighting. That would be `brew install ledger` and choosing [`Ledger syntax highlighting`]() in package-control. 

Now, [according to this]()

# Catherine 

She wrote first, so this feels like coming in second place. I can now understand why the trope exists where people exchange letters/notes/gifts.

So here is the start from my perspective. 

I arrived. Nothing was working out the way I thought it would. The media says we follow a pattern. Children go to school, get a job, get a car, leave for college, acquire a suiting job, and somewhere insert all the other things that come from maturing. 

I just haven't. I avoided things as long as possible out of fear. I've been afraid of everything, thinking there's something wrong with me. Not sure what. It's never been a concrete idea.

So, this was surprising.

It started to change the day of the Potter's Field guy said something. There was a strange involuntary bout of emotion the next day. I drew conclusions about the cause and started talking to people. *Actually* speaking about thoughts and ideas I've had for a long time. All things became less scary. I still need to deal with the consequences of inaction, staleness, a lack of growth.

...

I didn't understand why she did the things she does. So I asked. 

I learned how graceful she is. Each motion with purpose toward her goal. 

I learned about her responsibility: devotions in the morning, attending with consistency, being knowledgeable when prodded.

I learned she's a steward; aiming to make the most of the time she's been given. 

I know it seems small, but she ate the leftovers. 

...

She's truth; the reliable and sure kind. Catherine is a good proof, where $A \thn B \thn C$, not some hand-wavy proof based on *choice*. 
Catherine speaks the truth, even if it offends. At first it was shocking and surprising; then wonderful. It doesn't *feel* like her thoughts need to be guessed. 

She has purpose. She determined her interests and decided to follow through, being mindful as she goes. You can see it when she's creating in the craft room, designing at her laptop, judging elements (and deals) at shops, or thinking about the next project.

She's logical. I've always had the (misguided) impression girls were bundles of emotion and irrationally at times; that's not the case with her. Even when it *looks* like she's doing something slightly whimsical from the outside, she'll respond with either an argument or an assertion. 

...

I just can't find any fault in her. I know they have to exist, but I might be blinded by affection.

# Call to Worship: Open Winter Retreat 2018

* Note. `()` indicate where the idea is from. I think that's important. 
* Note. (i) and the barfing part are what I wanted to say at the pizza place. Other things are later ideas. 

## (i) Don't be afraid of... 
* now/intangibles
    - internal motivations
    - gods plan
    - the people around you (jamie)
* later/time 
    - week
    - month
    - year

## (ii) instead barf your cares on jesus (Scooty C.)
- be humble by throwing worries at him, 1 Peter 5:7 
* be anxious for nothing (nice church lady)
    - talks with him => receice peace, Phillipians 4:6-7
* complain/be-honest since he knows anyway (mike h.)
    - David was honest before God, Psalm 142:1-7
* extra ref: 
    - Anxiety is inert, matt. 6:25-34

## (iii) and step out (broderson)
* priests stepping into the river with the ark in joshua (the Jordan)
    - The river recedes after the priests step into the river, Joshua 3:13 
* if your heart doesn't condem you => go full boar
    - in confidence after speaking with god (1 john 3)

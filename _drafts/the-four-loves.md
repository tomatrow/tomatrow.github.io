## Affection 

### Summary 

Affection is called *storge* be the Greeks. It's composed of the *Need-Love* and *Gift-Love*. An often paradox since we *need* to *give* love. It can exist for any object, but requires familiarity. It sneaks up on you. Living with the comfortable everyday life of socks, dishes, blankets, and cats. 

But, it is not alone. It can be, but often not. It combines with other more demanding loves to create a balance for quiet times. 

Quite often, affection brings together the completely contrary, placing personal taste below the quality of the object in it's own right. Affection broadens our taste for humanity. 

Here be dragons. Affection peskily expects little from others and revives easily. Yet, reasonably, each tolerable person expects affection for himself. Unfortunately, we might be intolerable, expecting this love *by right* in lieu of reason. The same familiarity used by affection could germ deep-seated hated: "his old tricks", "his old ways". 

If you want love, be lovable. 

Another monster. Affection and courtesy are bound together; by ritual in public and true intimacy in private. Swapping formality between is incongruous. Dropping courtesy all-together makes a fiend. 

More monsters. Jealousy is connected to loves; most of all affection, since it's the most instinctual. We feel left behind when the object changes from its familiar state. This *left behind* is either (1) abandonment or (contradictorily) (2) envy. 

All these perversions of affection were concerned with *Need-love*. A demon also hides in *Gift-love*. 

The only perversion is the *need to be needed*. Instinctual Affection is fulfilled by *a higher love* which wants good for object itself; not just what we can give it. Consider the house-cat. We make it invalid, a sink for *Gift-love*; an unfortunate substitute for the genuine item. It's not always cat.

Now, don't trivialize these perversions. Firstly, it's not *just* the crazies; you're included. It's not *unnatural* for fallen men; so acknowledge the task and ask God (mot medicine) for help. Secondly, a *higher love* needs to step in to control affection instincts. Else, this love becomes a God, which is, actually, hatred as a demon. For flavor, consider the pleasures of hatred; you are in the wrong, and you love it.

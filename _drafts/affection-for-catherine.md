As a sidenote, these feelings might be rooted at a day in the park, a long (maybe not *so* long) time ago. I had this idea for a second then, but it seemed quite silly. It was Catherine, Carissa, Marson, Ameri, Tim, and I at the (slightly ghetto) Vista park. There were these rocks, quite hard to climb over, so she required support for a time.

She was quiet and mysterious and a little indifferent. I thought she was just annoyed by me. That would be sad, but fine. I still had no idea who she was.

So I asked questions, getting a clearer picture.

I'd made assumptions; they were wrong. Her interests are _, her plans are _, the effort she puts into things is _, her jokes are _, her habits are _, her love for people is _; where _ can be replaced by "surprising", "uncommon", or "honest".

As an example, consider her "love for people". It surprised me when she said she doesn't really want to talk to certain people, yet it's a terribly sensible thing to say. Also consider her interest in insects. 

I also find how she works around physical obstacles interesting. It feels strange to say so.

Thus, affection grew up around interaction: dinners, dishes, outings, silly words or actions, and other ordinary things. It was terribly frightening. I wanted to give her my time, and have hers. Also very strange. Throughout this time she would say things that slightly break the world: unexpected encouragement, simple truths about the world, insight on who God is for man, harsh (but true) statements concerning quite ordinary things. 

More research was needed.

I found a framework on types of love using Tim and CS Lewis, asked Jaime if these feelings were even allowed, and did informal case studies on Evan, Trevor, Nic, and Brad.

The conclusion was that it's *okay* to feel this way. Not bad. Maybe even good.

Was she the same? Maybe, but I tend to read into things, so I didn't try to interpret her actions or words. I also wouldn't make an assertion.

Strangely enough, she does feel the same.

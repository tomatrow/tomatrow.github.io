# Notes on *Fearless*

## Chapter 01 

The moral tune becomes discord when any note steps out of line. Fear is one of these notes. It's a perfectly fine emotion; protecting us from harm. When it takes main stage as the conductor, we call it cowardice.

Our foundation will be Paul's words to Timothy concerning fear: "For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands, for God gave us a spirit not of fear butÂ of power and love and self-control."

So the implications are two-fold. (1) We have a choice in the matter (fanning the flame) and (2) God supplies the necessary ingredients (power, love, self-control).

So, based on The Talents, we should choose risk/investment despite fear. 


## Chapter 02 

The lower fears compete with God for obedience making us cowards that dodge every obstacle, while the higher fear is meshed with love. As in, his power is terribly great, yet he is good; how could we fear anything else? This fear is confidence (Proverbs 14:26). 

So, beware the *evil report*, like the ten spies, which minimizes God and magnifies your weakness. Be Strong and Couragous like Joshua was; God is with us where we go. 

It starts by choosing to fear God at each opportunity. 

## Chapter 03 

Fear isn't a neutral feeling. It builds phantom walls around our hearts; saying "*I can't"*. 

Fear/worry actually steal our time by making us (1) *experience* plausible pain and (2) adhere to self fulfilling prophecy. 

Thinking is a physical process => so is fear => what does fear do to us *physically*?

So fear is bad, now how do we fix it? 
(1) sadness: complain/blame/ignore the present/past/people/God
(2) dominion: accept responsibility for all things


## Chapter 04 

Control is false Dominion. 

Consider Peter. He was *the rock*, chopping ears off, swearing to death with Jesus. Then Jesus shatters his idea of an earthly kingdom by reattaching an ear. Peter was fearless by control; so its sudden loss caused that terrible denial. 

Thus, surrender; like Jesus in Gethsemane. This surrender is a *choice* made before the situation calls for it. Full surrender/faith seems unobtainable; but remember just *believing* is obedience (John 6:29). 

Know we can fail, and suffer consequences. David failed, yet he was after God's heart because he never chose to follow another. 

Note, Dominion $\not=$ to Control. Dominion is choosing *right* within our own realms of authority. We are given authority in (1) subduing the earth and (2) guarding our thoughts.

A pitfall is mistaking things outside our control as in our Dominion. All we can do is fear.

Note, your dominion increases as you (riskfully) influence for good.

Again, overcoming fear is a process. 


## Chapter 05

We tend to rely on other's confidence in Christ; it's like training wheels. Let "Standing Alone" be the time after, where we find confidence in Christ *alone*. An analogus situation is the lovers love overruling any other care. Holiness is an effect of fearing the Lord (2 Cor. 7:1), and *strengthens* our ability to "stand alone". Now, we are already made holy by Christ (Heb. 10:14).

On a personal note, the same (actually correctly placed) jealousy I felt for Catherine just *messaging* another guy, is a small part of what God feels when we turn. 

Biblical holiness is *identity*; knowing you are set apart *for* God and not your own. It is *not* Legalsism; nothing external you *do* or cultural you *are*. Note, this holiness *makes* you like God, legalism says you are *already* like God. Now, we Stand Alone, but we also must Embrace Community. Jesus had parents, firends, pastors, then diciples; Paul traveled with others. We are called to both in diferent seasons. 


## Chapter 06 

The HS gives us power (2 Tim. 1:7) which is translated as ability (*dunamis*), concerning miacles or dominion (*exousia*), concerning disease/spirits. We need it too, since we're frail creatures. 

We recieve his power by *beliving* in it, yet you might need to choose to *do it scared*. But, how do we use power? (1) pray based on God's providence, asking his purpose, knowing the HS says what you can't put to words (2) throw your anxieties/worries/concerns on Jesus's shoulder's and trust him, maybe attaching a physical action to the experience (3) partner with God, taking action, going as far as you can and knowing God does fulfills the rest. 


## Chapter 07 

Esther worked for love (Es. 8:3-6) of *everyone*, not just herself.

Fitting, I'm listening to Extravegant.  

Love protects, sets boundaries, and is (appropriatly) jealous; all things promised by fear. 
Fear is about *me*: "How will this affaect me?", "Is this safe?". 
Love is about *the other*: "How will this affect others?", "Is this good?"

Each line of Love defined in 1 Cor. 13:4-8 can made opposite fear. Including Fear enjoying unrighteousness since it proves *fear* right. 


Where does fear come from? See 1 John 4:7-18 for this. 
* (1) God loved us via Jesus's death; we learn love by confessing him. 
* (2) Love others, fear leaves. 
* (3) Practicing love fits with God's love. 

Love hurts, since people will let you down, but never truing things is worthless. There's no growth. These relationship teach us what God's love is like. 

His love remains if you accept it, else theres no relationship, similar to loving our enemies. 

Love is a perfection process: recieving God's love, loving others, loving our enemies. So love everyone with action (Rom. 13:10). 

Focus on increasing in Love (Rom. 12:21). 


## Chapter 8 

We entertain ourselves with (temporary) physical fear and (less transient) terror. Terror projects a false reality. Ex: The ten spies said the enemy saw Isreal as *grasshoppers* while Rehab said their hearts *melted* from Isreal. 

Doublmindedness is knowing truth, yet wavering. We want to fear God, be holy, and love. To that end, commit to God's plan and align with the Word. This obedience is non-trivial, so *get help* and build each other up. Also, turn off negitive input like reddit, the news, horror movies. In summary we can have a sound mind by armoring (Eph. 6:10-18).  


## Chapter 9

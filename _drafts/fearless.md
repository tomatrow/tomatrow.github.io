# Notes on *Fearless*

## Chapter 01 

The moral tune becomes discord when any note steps out of line. Fear is one of these notes. It's a perfectly fine emotion; protecting us from harm. When it takes main stage as the conductor, we call it cowardice.

Our foundation will be Paul's words to Timothy concerning fear: "For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands, for God gave us a spirit not of fear butÂ of power and love and self-control."

So the implications are two-fold. (1) We have a choice in the matter (fanning the flame) and (2) God supplies the necessary ingredients (power, love, self-control).

So, based on The Talents, we should choose risk/investment despite fear. 


## Chapter 02 

The lower fears compete with God for obedience making us cowards that dodge every obstacle, while the higher fear is meshed with love. As in, his power is terribly great, yet he is good; how could we fear anything else? This fear is confidence (Proverbs 14:26). 

So, beware the *evil report*, like the ten spies, which minimizes God and magnifies your weakness. Be Strong and Couragous like Joshua was; God is with us where we go. 

It starts by choosing to fear God at each opportunity. 

## Chapter 03 

Fear isn't a neutral feeling. It builds phantom walls around our hearts; saying "*I can't"*. 

Fear/worry actually steal our time by making us (1) *experience* plausible pain and (2) adhere to self fulfilling prophecy. 

Thinking is a physical process => so is fear => what does fear do to us *physically*?

So fear is bad, now how do we fix it? 
(1) sadness: complain/blame/ignore the present/past/people/God
(2) dominion: accept responsibility for all things


## Chapter 04 

Control is false Dominion. 

Consider Peter. He was *the rock*, chopping ears off, swearing to death with Jesus. Then Jesus shatters his idea of an earthly kingdom by reattaching an ear. Peter was fearless by control; so its sudden loss caused that terrible denial. 

Thus, surrender; like Jesus in Gethsemane. This surrender is a *choice* made before the situation calls for it. Full surrender/faith seems unobtainable; but remember just *believing* is obedience (John 6:29). 

Know we can fail, and suffer consequences. David failed, yet he was after God's heart because he never chose to follow another.

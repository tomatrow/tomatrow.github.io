## Intro 

Like much of the NT, Hebrews is written to people that grew up on the OT and know Jesus in the present. These NT Christians were prepared for instruction, which is why reading it now is such a rich experience. 

## Context 

Hebrews is a series of reasons on *why* Jesus is better than everything. This passage focuses on one aspect. 

## Reading 

### Preeminence 

Namely $Jesus \sim Love$, $Moses \sim Law$, and $Jesus > Moses$ $\thn$ $Love > Law$. 

I get caught up in the right/wrong of things, which we should to an extent. But, instead of trying to determine whither a choice was the right via bible, I *first* should be talking with him directly. 

### Workmanship 

Namely, $Jesus \sim Builder$, $Moses \sim House$, $Moses \sim Us$, and $Builder > House$. 

We, humanity, are his work. He forms *people* into *family* for his good pleasure. The end goal being a creature that freely chooses to love his creator. How much more worthy of glory is his craft than what we can do.

# Call to Worship 01

### Version 01 
* assumptions 
    * you're a Christian 
    * *want* to turn into a creature that belongs with God
* trust God with your life even if it's to *change* you **where** *change* is 
    * increase in a virtue 
        * Ex. 
            - Personal. humility
            * Random. patience
* Don't intentionally: 
    * (1) engineer trials for *change* 
        * Ex. 
            - Personal. lazy => borrow money for pressure 
            - Random. patience => stick yourself in a situation 
    * (2) avoid trials for fear of *change* 
        * Ex. 
            - Personal. responsibility => act like a child
            - Random. stewardship => act you're incapable 
    * caveats: 
        - (1),(2) were without seeking God
        - $trials \not= chastisement$...maybe $trials \subset chastisement$
* why let him handle the process? 
    * hes our father => he raises us, Heb. 12:10
    * he started the process => he will finish it, Heb. 12:2
        - he began it, Gal. 3:3
        - he will complete it, Phil. 1:6
* So, what *do* we do? 
    * be encouraged since Jesus endured, Heb. 12:3
    * be ready, Heb. 12:12
        * examples: pray/read

#### Comments 

"Looks good. The only phrasing I would change would be that first line, 'trust God to change you where change is.' If I'm understanding it right I might change it to 'Trust God's plan for your life even if there is change to you personally.'" - Alex

Instagram used to have a public API. That was removed at some point. So, people have discovered the private API by inspecting Instagram for iOS/Android.

The best library out there is [`mgp25`](<>)'s [`Instagram-API`](<>) which is written in [`php`](<>).

We're going to do the following:

-   (1) Install the prerequisite tools/libraries
-   (2) _Livestream_ a saved video

I'm assuming you're running a newer version of MacOS.

## The Process

### Prerequisite Installations

We will install:

-   (1) `homebrew`
-   (2) `composer`
-   (3) `Instagram-API`
-   (4) `liveBroadcast.php`

### Live-streaming

We will:

-   (1) enter our username/passsword
-   (2) enter the video's location
-   (3) run it

## Intro

*an illustration on how people can choose to (not) see God in life*

## Theology Without Apology

The majority of the American Church are ignorant concerning the faith. This book is basic theology. 

## What the Bible Says About God

If your idea of God isn't a projection from the bible, then what are you worshiping?

## "I Believe God"

Believing in God will change your perspective (not necessarily circumstance). 

## God Exists, and He Created the Universe and Mankind

* Note. Bible assumes God exists. 
* Argument. Not sure where matter comes from => God exists
* Note. Purpose of Christianity: 
    - To know God, John 17:3
    - To know *him*, Phil. 3:10

### God is Omniscient

* Note. He has capacity: He know each star by name, Psalm 147:4
* Note. He knows us: 
    - before we act, Psalm 139:1-4
    - every detail, Matt. 10:30
    - every sorrow, Psalm 56:8
    - every kindness, Matt. 6:6
    - => take comfort since he cares, Matt. 10:31
* Note. All things will be made known: 
    - He see all things, Heb. 4:13
    - All time, Isiah 46:10 
    - => Have caution

### God is Omnipresent

* Note. All realms: 
    - Heaven, Earth, and Hell, Psalm 139 7-12
* Note. He is with us: 
    - Currently, Heb. 13:5
    - Always, Matt. 28:20
    - Traveling, Isaiah 43:2-3


### God is Omnipotent

* Question. "Can Go make a rock so large he can't lift it?"
    * Implicit Assumption: there exists a mass God can't move 
        - If true => He's not God, a contradiction
        - => false
* Note. His power is incomprehensible, Eph. 3:20
